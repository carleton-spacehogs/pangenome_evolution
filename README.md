We performed assembly, mapping, and binning using common methods and softwares (see Methods).

We then created a pangenome profile for Sulfurovum MAGs using anvi'o. We then performed subsequent analyses using the genome and contigs profile databases in anvi'o.

Fig. 1A: anvi-pan-display function on anvi'o pangenome workflow. The summary results in file Sulfurovum_gene_clusters_summary_cleaned.txt (cluster summary file)

Fig. 1B: Use the cluster summary file and run similarity_matrix.py to get a file similarity_matrix.txt which contains a matrix of content similarity (or inclusion) between two MAGs (see Results). We visualized this matrix in a heatmap using Viz1b.R, complemented by the dendrogram.
